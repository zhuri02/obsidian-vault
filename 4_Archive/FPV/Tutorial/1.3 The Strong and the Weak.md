Again consider the assertions that hold at point C of assignment 2. Discuss the following question:

**1. When annotating the control flow graph, can you say that one of the given assertions is "better" than the others?**
- Yes for example in the case $x = i \cdot n \land i = 10$ is stronger than $i = 10$.

**2. Can you arrange the given assertions in a meaningful order?**
- I will do that starting from the weakest to the strongest.
$$\begin{aligned}&1.\hspace{3mm} i \ge 0 \\ 
&2.\hspace{3mm} i > 0 \\
&3. \hspace{3mm} i = 10 \\
&3. \hspace{3mm} x = 10n \\
&5. \hspace{3mm} x = i \cdot n \land i = 10
\end{aligned} 
$$
- at the $i = 10 \hspace{2mm} and \hspace{2mm} x = 10n$ I made the same number because you cannot say that one is stronger than the other. But we can directly conclude that $x = i \cdot n \land i = 10$ is the strongest assertion of them all and $i \ge 0$ is the weakest.

**3. How can you define a stronger than relation formally?**
- I some sense, an assertion $A$ is stronger than an assertion $B$, if $A$ extends or includes the information of $B$. For example: 
- $(x = i \cdot n \land i = 10 \Rightarrow i = 10) \land (i = 10 \Rightarrow i >0) \land (i > 0 \Rightarrow i \ge 0)$

**4. How do $\textcolor{green}{\textbf{true}}$ and $\textcolor{red}{\textbf{false}}$ fit in and what is their meaning as an assertion?**
Since $\textcolor{red}{\textbf{false}} \Rightarrow A \text{ and } A \Rightarrow \textcolor{green}{\textbf{true}}$ hold $\forall A$ ,$\textcolor{red}{\textbf{false}}$ and $\textcolor{green}{\textbf{true}}$ are the strongest and weakest assertions, respectively. While `true` is always satisfied, there is no assignment of variable values that can ever satisfy `false`. The only way for a program not to violate an assertion `false` is to never reach the respective program point.  

**5. What are the strongest assertions that still hold at `A, B and C`**
- At A it still holds: $i = 0$
- At B it still holds: $i \ge 0 \land x \ge 0$ and $n = 1 \Rightarrow x = i$ 
- At C it still hold: $x = i \cdot n \land i = 10$
