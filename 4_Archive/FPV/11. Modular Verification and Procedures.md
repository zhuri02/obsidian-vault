### Idea
- Consider statements of the form:
$$\{A\}\hspace{5mm} p \hspace{5mm}\{B\}$$
- If $\textcolor{skyblue}{\textbf{before}}$ the execution of program fragment p, assertion $A$ holds and program execution terminates, then $\textcolor{skyblue}{\textbf{after}}$ execution of p assertion $B$ hold:
- $$ \begin{aligned}&\text{A} &&\text{:} &\textcolor{skyblue} {\textbf{pre-condition}} \\ &\text{B} &&\text{:} &\textcolor{skyblue} {\textbf{post-condition}}\\\end{aligned}$$
### Examples
$$ \begin{aligned}&\{x > y\} &z= x - y &&\{z > 0 \} \\
&\{\textcolor{green}{\textbf{true}}\} &\text{if } (x < 0) x = -x &&\{x \ge 0 \} \\
&\{x > 7\} &\text{while } (x!=0)\hspace{2mm} x=x-1; &&\{x = 0\} \\
&\{\textcolor{green}{\textbf{true}}\} &\text{while} (\textcolor{green}{\textbf{true}}); && \{\textcolor{red}{\textbf{false}}\}
\end{aligned}$$
$\textcolor{skyblue}{\textbf{Modular verification}}$ can be used to prove the correctness of programs using functions / methods.

### Simplification:
We only consider
- $\textcolor{skyblue}{\textbf{procedures}}$, i.e., static methods without return values;
- $\textcolor{skyblue}{\textbf{global variables}}$, i.e., all variables are `static` as well. 
### Example:
```java
int a, b;                     
int x, y; 

void main () { 
	a = read(); 
	b = read(); 
	mm(); 
	write (x - y); 
} 
```
```java
void mm() { 
 if (a > b) { 
	 x = a; 
	 y = b; 
 } else { 
	 y = a; 
	 x = b; 
 } 
}
```
### Comment 
- for simplicity, we have removed all qualifiers static.
- the procedure definitions are not recursive.
- The program reads two numbers.
- the procedure min-max stores the larger number in x, and the smaller number in y.
- The difference of x and y is returned.
- Our goal is to prove: 
$$\{a \ge b\} \text{ mm(); } \{a = x\}$$

### Approach
- For every procedure `f()`, we provide a triple
$$\{A\} \text{ f(); } \{B\}$$
- Relative to this $\textcolor{skyblue}{\textbf{global hypothesis}}$ `H` we verify for each procedure definition `void f() { ss }` that
$$\{A\} \textbf{ ss } \{B\} \text{ holds.}$$
- Wherever a procedure call occurs in the program, we rely on the triple form `H` $\dots$ 

- We verify: ![[Pasted image 20240902142448.png]]
### Discussion

- the approach also works in case the procedure has a return value: that can be simulated by means of a global variable return which receives the respective function results.
- It is not obvious, though, how pre- and post-conditions of procedure calls can be chosen if a procedure is called in $\textcolor{skyblue}{\textbf{multiple}}$ places $\dots$ 
- Even more complicated is the situation when a procedure is $\textcolor{skyblue}{\textbf{recursive}}$: then it has possibly unboundedly many distinct calls.
