- Annotate each program point with an assertion.
- Program start should receive annotation true.
- Verify for each statement `s` between two assertions `A` and `B`, that `A` implies the weakest pre-condition of s for B i.e., $\hspace{5mm}A \Rightarrow WP[s](B)$  

- Verify for each conditional branching with condition `b`, whether the assertion `A` before the condition implies the weakest pre-condition for the postconditions $B_0$  and $B_1$ of the branching, i.e., $\hspace{5mm}A \Rightarrow WP[b](B_0, B_1)$    
-  An annotation with the last two properties is called locally consistent (lc).
