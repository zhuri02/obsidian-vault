- Consider the assignment: $\hspace{10mm}x = y + z$
- In order to have after the assignment: $\hspace{10mm}x > 0\hspace{5mm} \text{//post-condition}$
- We must have before the assignment: $\hspace{10mm}y + z > 0\hspace{5mm}\text{pre-condition}$

- Every assignment transforms a post-condition B into a minimal assumption that must be valid before the execution so that B is valid after the execution.

- In case of an assignment $x = e$ the weakest pre-condition is given by $WP[x = e](B) \equiv B[e/x]$

- This means: we substitute everywhere in B, x by e !!!

- An arbitrary pre-condition A for a statement s is valid, whenever $A \Rightarrow WP[s](B)$  // A implies the weakest pre-condition for B this is called $\textcolor{skyblue}{\textbf{local consistency}}$! 

- assignment: $\hspace{5mm} x = x - y$
- post-condition: $\hspace{5mm}x > 0$

- weakest pre-condition: $\hspace{5mm}x - y > 0$
- stronger pre-condition: $\hspace{5mm}x - y > 2$
- even stronger pre-condition: $\hspace{5mm} x - y = 3$
