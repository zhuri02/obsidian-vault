- Procedures `f()` modify global variables.
- The values of local variables of the caller before and after the call remain unchanged i.e. 
```java
{int y = 17; double(); write(y);}
```
Before and after the call of `double()` we have: $\hspace{3mm} y = 17$.

- The values of local variables are $\textcolor{skyblue}{\textbf{automatically}}$ preserved, if the global hypothesis has the following properties:
$\color{green}\Rightarrow$ The pre- and post conditions: $\{A\}, \{B\}$ of procedures only speak about global variables !
$\color{green}\Rightarrow$ The `h`are only used for global variables !!
- As a new specific instance of adaptation, we obtain:$$\frac{\{A\} f();\{B\}}{\{A\land C\}f();\{B\land C\}} \hspace{10mm} \text{if C only speaks about logical or local variables of the caller.}$$
### Summary
- Every further language construct requires dedicated verification techniques.
